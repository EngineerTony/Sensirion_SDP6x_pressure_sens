  SDP6x - A Low Pressor Sensor Library for Arduino.

  Supported Sensor modules:
    SDP600 series from Sensirion - http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/Technologies/Product.aspx?ProductID=SDP610125PASENSIRIONAG1050689&IM=0
  
  SHT2x Created by Christopher Ladden at Modern Device on December 2009.
  SDP6x Modified above by Antony Burness Jun 2016.
    - adapted for the I2C Pressure sensor
    - using example from sensirion https://www.sensirion.com/products/differential-pressure-sensors/all-documents-of-sensirions-differential-pressure-sensors-for-download/
